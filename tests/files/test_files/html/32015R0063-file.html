Those elements which would supplement the risk criteria provided for in Article 103(7) of Directive 2014/59/EU should be established in a way to preserve a level playing field among the Member States and a strong internal market by avoiding discrepancies between Member States' approaches to the calculation of contributions to their respective resolution financing arrangements.

Such a methodology should allow for a proportionate system of annual contributions as, in determining the annual contribution of each institution, the resolution authority has to comply with an annual target level of the financing arrangement.

               <p class="normal">A distinction should be made within the category of small institutions as some are very small, while others are close to the maximum thresholds allowing them to benefit from the simplified system. Under a single lump-sum system, the annual contributions of very small institutions would be disproportionately higher than those of the small institutions which are close to reaching the maximum thresholds. At the same time, it should be avoided that the simplified system leads to a disproportionate difference in terms of annual contributions between the biggest among small institutions and the institutions which do not qualify for the simplified system as they are just above the thresholds. To avoid such unwanted effects it is therefore appropriate to foresee a system of several categories of small institutions whose annual contributions should consist of different lump sum amounts. This should allow for a progression of contributions within the simplified system, and between the highest lump sum and the lowest contribution pursuant to the method whereby the basic annual contribution is adjusted according to the risk profile of the institution.</p>

As this cannot be achieved exclusively by providing for a range for assessing the risk profile, but requires a certain degree of discretion in deciding upon the importance of certain risk indicators on a case by case basis, the weight of some risk indicators should only be indicative, or a range should be set out in their respect to allow the resolution authorities to decide upon the relevance of those indicators in a given case.</p>
