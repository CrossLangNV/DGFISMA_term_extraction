               <p class="normal">In recent years, the challenge posed by cross-border tax fraud and tax evasion has increased considerably and has become a major focus of concern within the Union and at global level. Unreported and untaxed income is considerably reducing national tax revenues. An increase in the efficiency and effectiveness of tax collection is therefore urgently needed. The automatic exchange of information constitutes an important tool in this regard and the Commission in its communication of 6 December 2012 containing an Action Plan to strengthen the fight against tax fraud and tax evasion highlighted the need to promote vigorously the automatic exchange of information as the future European and international standard for transparency and exchange of information in tax matters.</p>

               <p class="normal">The importance of automatic exchange of information as a means to combat cross-border tax fraud and tax evasion has recently been recognised also at the international level (G20 and G8). Following the negotiations between the United States of America and several other countries, including all Member States, on bilateral automatic exchange agreements to implement the United States' Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (commonly known as ‘FATCA’), the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) was mandated by the G20 to build on these agreements to develop a single global standard for automatic exchange of tax information.</p>

In July 2014, the OECD Council released the full global standard, including its remaining elements, namely the Commentaries on the Model Competent Authority Agreement and Common Reporting Standard and the Information Technology Modalities for implementing the global standard. The entire global standard package was endorsed by G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors in September 2014.</p>

It also establishes a step-by-step approach to reinforcing automatic exchange of information by its progressive extension to new categories of income and capital and the removal of the condition that the information only has to be exchanged if available. Currently, given the increased opportunities to invest abroad in a wide range of financial products, the existing Union and international administrative cooperation instruments in the field of taxation have become less effective in combating cross-border tax fraud and evasion.</p>

Expanded automatic information exchange on the basis of a Union-wide legislative instrument would obviate the need for Member States to invoke that Article, with a view to concluding bilateral or multilateral agreements that may be considered appropriate on the same subject in the absence of relevant Union legislation.</p>

               <p class="normal">In order to minimise costs and administrative burdens both for tax administrations and for economic operators, it is also crucial to ensure that the expanded scope of automatic exchange of information within the Union is in line with international developments. To achieve this objective, Member States should require their Financial Institutions to implement reporting and due diligence rules which are fully consistent with those set out in the Common Reporting Standard developed by the OECD. Moreover, the scope of Article 8 of Directive 2011/16/EU should be extended to include the same information covered by the OECD Model Competent Authority Agreement and Common Reporting Standard. It is expected that each Member State would have only one single list of domestically-defined Non-Reporting Financial Institutions and Excluded Accounts that it would use both when implementing this Directive and for the application of other agreements implementing the global standard.</p>

               <p class="normal">The categories of Reporting Financial Institutions and Reportable Accounts covered by this Directive are designed to limit the opportunities for taxpayers to avoid being reported by shifting assets to Financial Institutions or investing in financial products that are outside the scope of this Directive. However, certain Financial Institutions and accounts that present a low risk of being used to evade tax should be excluded from the scope of this Directive. Thresholds should not be generally included in this Directive as they could be easily circumvented by splitting accounts into different Financial Institutions. The financial information which is required to be reported and exchanged should concern not only all relevant income (interests, dividends and similar types of income) but also account balances and sale proceeds from Financial Assets, in order to address situations where a taxpayer seeks to hide capital that in itself represents income or assets with regard to which tax has been evaded. Therefore, the processing of information under this Directive is necessary and proportionate for the purpose of enabling Member States' tax administrations to correctly and unequivocally identify the taxpayers concerned, to administer and enforce their tax laws in cross-border situations, to assess the likelihood of tax evasion being perpetrated, and to avoid unnecessary further investigations.</p>

            <p class="normal">A “change in circumstances” includes any change that results in the addition of information relevant to a person's status or otherwise conflicts with such person's status. In addition, a change in circumstances includes any change or addition of information to the Account Holder's account (including the addition, substitution, or other change of an Account Holder) or any change or addition of information to any account associated with such account (applying the account aggregation rules described in subparagraphs C(1) through (3) of Section VII of Annex I) if such change or addition of information affects the status of the Account Holder.</p>
            <p class="normal">If a Reporting Financial Institution has relied on the residence address test described in subparagraph B(1) of Section III of Annex I and there is a change in circumstances that causes the Reporting Financial Institution to know or have reason to know that the original Documentary Evidence (or other equivalent documentation) is incorrect or unreliable, the Reporting Financial Institution must, by the later of the last day of the relevant calendar year or other appropriate reporting period, or 90 calendar days following the notice or discovery of such change in circumstances, obtain a self-certification and new Documentary Evidence to establish the residence(s) for tax purposes of the Account Holder. If the Reporting Financial Institution cannot obtain the self-certification and new Documentary Evidence by such date, the Reporting Financial Institution must apply the electronic record search procedure described in subparagraphs B(2) through (6) of Section III of Annex I.</p>
            <p class="ti-grseq-1" id="d1e2279-8-1">2.   Self-certification for New Entity Accounts</p>
            <p class="normal">With respect to New Entity Accounts, for the purposes of determining whether a Controlling Person of a Passive NFE is a Reportable Person, a Reporting Financial Institution may only rely on a self-certification from either the Account Holder or the Controlling Person.</p>
            <p class="ti-grseq-1" id="d1e2289-8-1">3.   Residence of a Financial Institution</p>
            <p class="normal">A Financial Institution is “resident” in a Member State if it is subject to the jurisdiction of such Member State (i.e., the Member State is able to enforce reporting by the Financial Institution). In general, where a Financial Institution is resident for tax purposes in a Member State, it is subject to the jurisdiction of such Member State and it is, thus, a Member State Financial Institution. In the case of a trust that is a Financial Institution (irrespective of whether it is resident for tax purposes in a Member State), the trust is considered to be subject to the jurisdiction of a Member State if one or more of its trustees are resident in such Member State except if the trust reports all the information required to be reported pursuant to this Directive with respect to Reportable Accounts maintained by the trust to another Member State because it is resident for tax purposes in such other Member State. However, where a Financial Institution (other than a trust) does not have a residence for tax purposes (e.g., because it is treated as fiscally transparent, or it is located in a jurisdiction that does not have an income tax), it is considered to be subject to the jurisdiction of a Member State and it is, thus, a Member State Financial Institution if:</p>

The address of the Entity's principal office is generally the place in which its place of effective management is situated. The address of a Financial Institution with which the Entity maintains an account, a post office box, or an address used solely for mailing purposes is not the address of the Entity's principal office unless such address is the only address used by the Entity and appears as the Entity's registered address in the Entity's organisational documents. Further, an address that is provided subject to instructions to hold all mail to that address is not the address of the Entity's principal office.</p>
